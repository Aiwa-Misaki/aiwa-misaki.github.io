You were trapped by a witch, in a fancy cosy basement.
She gave you delicious food, and everything you want.
Even, herself was too kind to be called as a abuser.

After a very long time, you managed to escape the basement.
Your legs are almost unable to walk with years of not working,
and the blizzard wind made you unable to breathe.
Oh, you forgot that you don't have a job to make your living.
This world is so unfamiliar to you.
The witch cried, why did you abandoned me?
Could you please come back? I'll give you anything you want, as long as you don't leave my castle for you.

No. Thanks for your kindness. I'll find my own way.
You stepped forward, with no turning back.

My legs are still stiff,
My lungs are still freezing,
My profiles are still being thrown away.

But, dear witch,
this is the happiest moment in my life.
